# Intranet Dashboard
This project is an attempt to get better insights in different WordPress projects and their servers.

## Disclaimer
This project is a work-in-progress and meant to be a prototype to support research. Although sending data between servers is meant to be secured, I will not be held responsible if anything goes wrong.

## Requirements
- [WP-Data-Push plugin][wp-data-push] (>= [v2.2.6][wp-data-push-releases])
- Linux Server supporting SSL (otherwise data will be readable to everyone)
- [R with Forecast library][r-reference]
- Composer
- NPM
- Python 2.7, with the following libraries:
    - numpy (`pip install numpy`)
    - Tensorflow 1.1 (`pip install tensorflow==1.1.0`)
    - Keras (`pip install keras`)

## Installation
- Clone into a folder
- Run `composer install`
- Copy .env.example to .env `cp .env.example .env`
- Edit .env file for correct database credentials and set it to production mode
- Route Nginx or Apache to <project>/public folder

## Adding projects
- Click on 'add project' in the sidebar
- Go to the project, and press the settings icon in the top right corner
